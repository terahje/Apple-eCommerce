# Apple-eCommerce

## Description

This project highlights Apple and all its glory! The landing page has a floating cube spinning until you hover over the controls. I believe the star of the project is the MacBook Air section where on scrolling towards the section, the MacBook Air opens up and turns on. It adds such a high end feel to the section and I'm glad to have a chance to see how it came to life. The watches section was also very cool as its very simular to the one on Apples page.
